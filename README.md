# Project Repository (sc21ds)
Welcome to the main repository for my project! This repository houses code and results for various components of our project, organized into different folders for clarity.

## Folders
### 1. OpenAI RAG & Embeddings Chatbot 
   Contains code for all three trials of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model.

### 2. Seq2Seq Chatbot
   Houses code for all three trial runs of the Seq2Seq model.

### 3. NLG Evaluation
   Contains all the code and results related to Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation. Includes scripts, datasets, and output files from different evaluation experiments.
   
### 4. User Evaluation
   Stores all results from user evaluations along with consent forms.
   

## Additional Files
### 1. web_scrapper.ipynb: Python script for web scraping.

### 2. q&a_generator.py: Code for generating question and answer pairs (Q&A).


## Guide
Each folder contains its own README file with detailed information on each component. All code written were compiled on Google Colab Pro as it required high computational resources.
