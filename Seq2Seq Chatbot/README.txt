3) Chatbot_V2.ipynb
Notebook for the second trial, which likely includes modifications or enhancements based on the results from the first trial.

4) Chatbot_V3.ipynb
The third trial's notebook reflects further refinements and possibly focuses on more complex interaction scenarios or improved response accuracy.
